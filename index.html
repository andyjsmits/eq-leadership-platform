                    <h3>I'm too busy for another training program. How is this different?</h3>
                    <p>Most modules take 5 minutes. You can literally complete them while your coffee brews. No lengthy courses, no overwhelming homework. Just bite-sized improvements that add up.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will this work for church leadership specifically?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. We have specific content tracks for pastoral leadership, volunteer management, and church governance. Our scenarios come from real church situations, not generic business examples.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if my team isn't ready for 360 feedback?</h3>
                    <p>Start with the EQ assessment and learning modules. 360 feedback is completely optional and unlocks only when you're ready. Many leaders see significant improvement from the self-development content alone.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if the coaching is worth it?</h3>
                    <p>Our coaches are vetted specifically for nonprofit and church experience. Average session rating is 4.8/5. Plus, at $99/session vs. $300+ for typical executive coaching, the value is clear.</p>
