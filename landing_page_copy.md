### Headline
**You Didn't Sign Up to Be a Manager. But Here You Are.**

### Pain Points (3-column layout)

**Column 1: The Nonprofit Founder**
"I started this organization to change lives, not manage personality conflicts. Every day feels like I'm putting out fires instead of focusing on our mission. My team means well, but I can tell some are frustrated with my leadership‚ÄîI just don't know what I'm doing wrong."

**Column 2: The Church Pastor** 
"Seminary taught me theology, not team management. I can preach to 300 people, but I struggle to have one difficult conversation with a staff member. The elders keep asking about 'leadership development,' but I honestly don't even know where I'm lacking."

**Column 3: The Promoted Program Manager**
"Six months ago, I was running programs. Now I'm supposed to lead people, manage budgets, and represent our organization to donors. Nobody prepared me for this. I feel like I'm disappointing everyone, including myself."

### Supporting Statistics
- 73% of nonprofit executives report feeling unprepared for leadership responsibilities
- Average tenure for new church staff: 18 months
- #1 reason for nonprofit leadership turnover: interpersonal conflicts

### Testimonials

**Sarah M., Executive Director, Children's Nonprofit**
"I thought I was a decent leader until I took the EQ assessment. The results were eye-opening but not crushing. The learning modules gave me practical tools I could use immediately. Three months later, my team retention is up and our board meetings are actually productive."

**Pastor David R., Community Church**
"Seminary didn't prepare me for managing a staff of 12. This platform helped me understand why some conversations were so difficult and gave me a roadmap to improve. The coaching sessions were worth every penny."

**Maria L., Program Director turned ED**
"I was promoted because I was good at my job, not because I was ready to lead. The 360 feedback helped me see my blind spots, and the peer connections showed me I wasn't alone in feeling overwhelmed."
